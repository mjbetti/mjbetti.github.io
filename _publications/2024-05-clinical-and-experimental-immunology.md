excerpt: 'We report a case of very early onset imflammatory bowel disease caused by a novel homozygous loss of function mutation in IL10RB. We use cytometry by time-of-flight with a broad panel of antibodies to interrogate the immunophenotype of this patient and detect reduced frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells with additional defects in some populations of T helper cells, innate-like T cells, and memory B cells. Finally, we identify the patientâ€™s mutation as a founder allele in an isolated indigenous population and estimate the age of this variant by studying the shared ancestral haplotype.'
