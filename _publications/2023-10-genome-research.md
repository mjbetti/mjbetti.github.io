excerpt: "Here, we analyzed the genomic localization profiles of 529 sequence-specific TFs and 151 cofactors and chromatin regulators in the human cancer cell line HepG2, for a total of 680 broadly termed DNA-associated proteins (DAPs). We used this deep collection to model each TF's impact on gene expression, and identified a cohort of 26 candidate transcriptional repressors. We examine high occupancy target (HOT) sites in the context of three-dimensional genome organization and show biased motif placement in distal-promoter connections involving HOT sites. We also found a substantial number of closed chromatin regions with multiple DAPs bound, and explored their properties, finding that a MAFF/MAFK TF pair correlates with transcriptional repression."
