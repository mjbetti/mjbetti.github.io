excerpt: "We develop a polygenic risk scores for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in cancer-free individuals and then test these PRSs on immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated colitis in a cohort of 1316 patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated non-small cell lung cancer. Replication is them performed in a cohort of 873 immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated pan-cancer patients."
